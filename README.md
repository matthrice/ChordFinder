# ChordFinder
Identifies piano chords. The user highlights the keys of the unknown chord and ChordFinder returns the most fitting chord formation and root note. The program doesn't try to name every possible combination of keys, as that is an unnecessary tool for musicians. However, it is able to quickly and correctly identify 1000+ chords and chord inversions. 

Works best in Chrome.
